# Do you have a template to share? Great! :)

In order to prevent the uploading and sharing of templates with commercial licenses, we ask you to choose a [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) licence with link about your template.

You can add yourself as contributor, this helps if there is a dispute about the template, either because someone thinks it's their creation, or because you see it elsewhere as commercial template.

Guidelines about the supported formats:
- PNG, preferably transparent,
- the template must be 1404 x 1872, at the moment this is the only supported size,
- the thumbnail should be 351 x 468 (shrink to 1/4 the template),
- the name contains only lowercase letters, numbers and '-', like 'grey-lines-32',
- the name contains the brief of the template, like 'grey', 'lines' and '32'.
- the description preferably a short sentence or a shorter brief,
- single category, like 'grids' or 'lines',
- the filename should be the `name` + `.png`

Example of the file names:
- black-grey-lines-16-t.png
- black-grey-lines-16.json
- black-grey-lines-16.png

Example of the JSON content:
```
{
  "version":1,
  "data":{
    "contributor":{
      "email":"gabor.auth@toolsboox.com",
      "name":"GÃ¡bor AUTH"
    },
    "copyright":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",
    "name":"grey-lines-32",
    "description":"Grey lines (x32)",
    "category":"lines",
    "filename":"grey-lines-32.png"
  }
}
```

So, fork the repository, add your content, commit-push, and send a pull request about the template, I will check the files and the JSON.
